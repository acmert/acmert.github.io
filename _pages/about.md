Hello! I'm Ahmet Can Mert, a dedicated cryptographic hardware engineer and researcher. I received my Ph.D., MSc, and BSc in Electronics Engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey in 2015, 2017, and 2021, respectively. I was a post-doctoral researcher at IAIK, Graz University of Technology, Austria, between 2021 and 2024. My expertise/interest includes:

- Analysis and implementation of cryptographic algorithms on FPGA and ASIC platforms.

- (Fully) Homomorphic Encryption ((F)HE). I specialize in analyzing homomorphic encryption schemes and accelerating their computationally intensive operations through hardware-based implementations.

- Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Specifically, I have experience in hardware implementation of the NIST-standardized Kyber and Dilithium schemes, with a focus on efficient arithmetic operations. 

- I have expertise in analyzing and efficiently implementing primitive operations, such as the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), used in many modern cryptographic constructions like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), FHE and PQC.

Whether you're seeking a secure hardware solution or require cryptographic consulting, I'm ready to assist you. Please don't hesitate to contact me to discuss your specific needs.
