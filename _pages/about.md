I am currently a PhD candidate at [Electronics Engineering](https://ee.sabanciuniv.edu/en) in [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en), Istanbul, Turkey. I study under the supervision of Asst. Prof. Erdinc Ozturk and Prof. Erkay Savas at [Cryptography & Information Security (CISEC)](https://cisec.sabanciuniv.edu/) Group. I worked with Asst. Prof. Aydin Aysu as a visiting researcher at [Hardware and Embedded Cybersecurity Research Lab (HECTOR)](https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aaysu/) in [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), Raleigh, NC, in the summer of 2019. I received my BSc. and MSc. in Electronics Engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2015 and 2017 respectively. My research interests include homomorphic encryption, post-quantum cryptography, cryptographic hardware design and FPGAs. More specifically, I design hardware accelerator for lattice-based cryptography. Also, I work as a full-time research assistant at Electronics Engineering in Sabanci University since 2017.
